# Agentic guitar learning partner — agent instructions

## Goal and repository layout

Read `README.md` first.

The production focus is the guitar-controlled stereo PCM looper:

- `guitar-audio-looper.jolt` is the main entry point.
- `audio_looper/` contains its separated command policy, note reference, Csound
  DSP, embedded-engine transport, voice assets, runtime adapter, setup, dashboard,
  terminal integration, and offline checks.
- `AUDIO_LOOPER_PLAN.md` is the main design and verification record.
- `poc/` contains all previous experiments: early songs, pitch detectors, and
  note-based loopers.
- `poc/README.md` documents those historical POCs.

Do not depend on or edit the old sibling Jolt checkout. Do not add services,
daemons, controllers, REPL/nREPL workflows, dependency manifests, build tasks,
or a generic benchmark framework unless explicitly requested. There are no
`bb play/stop/status/test` tasks.

## Main PCM looper invariants

- Record and replay the actual stereo guitar PCM. Pitch is command input only;
  never convert the recorded performance to MIDI or resynthesize it.
- Preserve six equivalent slots, one active recorder, no overdub, and no silent
  overwrite of an existing clip.
- Keep command policy, note-event behavior, DSP, native transport, voice assets,
  setup, and terminal rendering separated and independently testable.
- Csound owns real-time work: CoreAudio, `pitchamdf`, sample clock, PCM tables,
  playback, fades, prompts, and mixing. Jolt must not perform per-block DSP.
- Preserve bounded sequenced host/native transport, matching operation IDs,
  fail-closed gaps, and publication only after native acknowledgement.
- Keep foreground ownership, Ctrl+C cleanup, terminal restoration, and the
  independent 600-second OS wall-clock alarm.
- `--live` is the only mode that may open an audio device. `--no-tui` intentionally
  selects line-oriented output; omit it when checking the fixed ANSI dashboard.
- Input selection is the only mandatory keyboard setup for FX100. The default
  C-major guitar command profile is octave-independent.
- Erase is a direct selected-slot command; guitar exit retains confirmation.
- The first/master clip may trim outer silence with documented preroll/tail.
  Later synchronized clips must preserve complete master-cycle phase.

## Previous POCs

Keep previous experiments under `poc/`; do not move them back to the repository
root. Keep generated WAV/AIFF files, Carp binaries, generated `guitar-loop.csd`,
temporary C, prompt assets, and rendered output out of git.

Treat POCs as historical unless the user explicitly asks to extend one. Preserve
the behavior of an individual POC when moving or documenting it, and run the
relevant offline command from `poc/README.md` after any change.

## Audio safety

Do not open live audio unless the user explicitly requests playback or live
validation. Metadata enumeration and offline rendering are safe.

Main looper offline gate:

```bash
jolt guitar-audio-looper.jolt --check
```

Playback is foreground-only; Ctrl+C stops it. Never introduce a daemon or leave
an audio, Csound, `say`, or SuperCollider process running after testing.

For a stop request, interrupt only the foreground process group owned by the
requested playback and verify its engine process exited before claiming silence.
Do not use stale controller commands, `killall`, or broad `pkill`; never signal
unrelated audio processes.

## Verification

For main-looper changes:

- Run `clj-kondo` and `cljstyle check` on changed Jolt sources.
- Run `jolt guitar-audio-looper.jolt --check`; it must not open an audio device.
- Compile-check `audio_looper/diagnostics.c` with the pinned Csound and libsndfile
  headers when native integration changes.
- For process/lifecycle changes, verify signal cleanup, terminal restoration, no
  stale owned process, and accurate nonzero failure exits.
- Only request another hardware pass after all relevant offline gates pass.

For previous-POC changes, use the relevant offline commands in `poc/README.md`
and avoid changing unrelated experiments.

Use temporary files for ad-hoc checks and renders. Do not add a framework solely
for verification.
